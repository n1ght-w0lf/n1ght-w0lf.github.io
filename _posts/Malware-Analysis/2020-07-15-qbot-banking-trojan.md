QBot is a modular information stealer also known as Qakbot or Pinkslipbot. It has been active for years since 2007. It has historically been known as a banking Trojan, meaning that it steals financial data from infected systems.

# Infection Flow

QBot can be delivered in various different ways including Malspam (Malicious Spam) or dropped by other malware families like Emotet.

The infection flow for this campaign is as follows:

[![1](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/1.png)](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/1.png)

First, the victim receives a phishing email with a link to a malicious zip file.

[![2](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/2.png)](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/2.png)

The zip file contains a very obfuscated VBS file which downloads and launches Qbot executable. 

[![3](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/3.png)](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/3.png)

The VBS file tries to download Qbot from different places:

- http://st29[.]ru/tbzirttmcnmb/88888888.png
- http://restaurantbrighton[.]ru/uyqcb/88888888.png
- http://royalapartments[.]pl/vtjwwoqxaix/88888888.png
- http://alergeny.dietapacjenta[.]pl/pgaakzs/88888888.png
- http://egyorg[.]com/vxvipjfembb/88888888.png

Notice the misleading URL, it looks like it's downloading a PNG image but the raw data says something else.

# Unpacking

QBot is packed with a custom packer, but the unpacking process is really simple. It allocates memory for the unpacked code using `VirtualAlloc()` and changes memory protection using `VirtualProtect()`. So we just need 2 breakpoints at  `VirtualAlloc()`  and  `VirtualProtect()`.

[![4](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/4.png)](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/4.png)

# Encrypted Strings

Most of QBot strings are encrypted (stored in a continuous blob) and they are decrypted on demand. The decryption routine accepts one argument which is the  index to the string then it XORs it with a hardcoded bytes array until it encounters a null byte.

We can use IDAPython to decrypt the strings and add them as comments.

```python
import idc
import idautils

dec_routine = 0x4065B7
enc_strings = 0x40B930
bytes_arr = 0x410120

def decrypt_string(idx):
    if idx >= 0x36F4:
        return    # out of bounds
    res = ""
    while True:
        c = idc.get_wide_byte(enc_strings+idx) ^ idc.get_wide_byte(bytes_arr + (idx&0x3F))
        if c == 0: break
        res += chr(c)
        idx += 1
    return res

xrefs = idautils.CodeRefsTo(dec_routine, 0)
for x in xrefs:
    ea = idc.prev_head(x)
    t = idc.get_operand_type(ea, 1)
    if t == idc.o_imm:
        idx = idc.get_operand_value(ea, 1)
        dec = decrypt_string(idx)
        idc.set_cmt(ea, dec, 1)
```

And here is the result, that's much easier to work with.

[![5](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/5.png)](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/5.png)

This should take care of most of the strings, the rest of strings indexes are calculated dynamically at runtime.

We decrypt all strings by looping through the encrypted blob and decrypt strings one by one.

```python
idx = 0
while idx < 0x36F4:
    dec = decrypt_string(idx)
    idx += len(dec)+1
    print(dec)
```

# Anti-Analysis

QBot spawns a new process of itself with the  `"/C"` parameter, this process is responsible for doing Anti-Analysis checks.

[![6](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/6.png)](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/6.png)

The parent process checks the exit code of this spawned process. If the exit code is not 0, it means that QBot is being analyzed (and so it exits).

[![7](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/7.png)](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/7.png)

So let's go over the anti-analysis techniques.

## Checking VM

In VMWare, communication with the host is done through a specific I/O  port `(0x5658)`, so QBot uses the `in` assembly instruction to detect VMWare by reading from this port and checking the return value in `ebx` if it's equal to `VMXh` (VMware magic value).

If we are outside VMWare, a privilege error occurs and this code will return 0.

[![8](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/8.png)](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/8.png)

Another Anti-VM trick is to check hardware devices against known devices names used by VMs and Sandboxes.

Here is the list of devices names.

## Checking Processes

QBot loops through running processes and compares their executable names against known analysis tools.

## Checking DLLs

Sandbox detection can be done by enumerating loaded DLLs and comparing them against known DLLs used by sandboxes. Here it's just using 2 of them.

```
ivm-inject.dll     # Buster Sandbox Analyzer
SbieDll.dll        # SandBoxie
```

## Checking Filename

Some sandboxes may change the sample file name. So QBot checks if its process name contains one of these strings.

```
sample
mlwr_smpl
artifact.exe
```

## Checking CPU

The last check is done using `CPUID` instruction. First it is executed with `EAX=0` to get the CPU vendor and compares it with `GenuineIntel` (Intel processor).

Then it is executed with `EAX=1` to get the processors features.

On a physical machine the last bit will be equal to 0. On a guest VM it will equal to 1.

[![9](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/9.png)](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/9.png)

# Back To Parent

After the Anti-Analysis checks, QBot drops a copy of itself along with a configuration file at `"%APPDATA%\Microsoft\<random_folder_name>"`.

[![10](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/10.png)](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/10.png)

Finally, QBot starts the dropped copy in a new process and overwrites itself with a legitimate executable, here it’s  `"calc.exe"`.

[![11](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/11.png)](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/11.png)

# Configuration File

The dropped configuration file is accessed frequently by Qbot, this file is RC4 encrypted. By setting a breakpoint before the contents of the file gets encrypted I got the following data:

| Field                      | Description                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 10=spx143                  | Campaign ID                                 |
| 11=2                       | Number of hardcoded C2                      |
| 1=13.59.00-24/06/2020      | Date of Qbot install in HH:MM:ss-dd/mm/yyyy |
| 2=1592996340               | Victim Qbot install                         |
| 50=1                       | N/A                                         |
| 5=VgBCAE8AWABTAFYAUgA7ADIA | Victim network shares                       |
| 38=1593047244              | Last victim call to C2 (Unix time)          |
| 45=187.163.101.137         | C2 IP                                       |
| 46=995                     | C2 port                                     |
| 39=45.242.76.104           | Victim external IP                          |
| 43=1593006172              | Time of record (Unix time)                  |
| 49=1                       | N/A                                         |

# Persistence

QBot achieves persistence by creating a new registry value under the key `"HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"`. It also registers a scheduled task that runs every 5 hours.

[![12](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/12.png)](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/12.png)

# Process Injection

QBot tries to inject its unpacked code in one of these processes `("explorer.exe", "mobsync.exe", "iexplorer.exe")` and it uses `Process Hollowing` technique to achieve that.

It first starts a new suspended process with `CreateProcessW()` then it writes the injected code into the target process using `ZwCreateSection()`, `ZwMapViewOfSection()` and `ZwWriteVirtualMemory()`.

Finally it sets the thread context to jump to the injected code and resume execution with `ResumeThread()`.

# Core Module

The injected code loads and decrypts one of its resources  `"307"` . After dumping it, I found out that it’s a DLL (this is the core module).

[![13](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/13.png)](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/13.png)

From now on, we will be analyzing the core DLL of QBot.

The core module has 2 resources both RC4 encrypted.

[![14](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/14.png)](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/14.png)

The first resource gets loaded into memory then RC4 decrypted.

[![15](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/15.png)](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/15.png)

The contents of the decrypted resource are:

- 10=spx143 (Campaign ID)

- 3=1592482956 (Timestamp)

After some digging, I found out how the resources are decrypted. The first **20** bytes of each resource are the RC4 key of this resource, and the rest are the actual encrypted data.

So by using this find, we can decrypt the other resource `"311"`.

[![16](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/16.png)](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/16.png)

Great!!! Now we have the list of C2 servers (150 servers!).

The reason there is many controllers is that these are actually just proxies of infected bots acting as intermediate nodes between the victim and the real C2 and thus hiding the backend infrastructure of the attacker.

So it works like this:

[![17](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/17.png)](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/17.png)

# C2 Communication

QBot obfuscates its communication with the C2 server by encrypting the payloads using RC4 and encoding the result using Base64.

The communication is also done over SSL, you can notice that the traffic has unusual certificate issuer data.

[![18](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/18.png)](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/18.png)

We can use `Fiddler` to intercept and decrypt the HTTPS traffic.

[![19](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/19.png)](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/19.png)

The RC4 key for encrypting the payload is the SHA1 hash of the first 16 bytes of the Base64-decoded payload + a hardcoded salt (The salt is stored as an encrypted string).

Here is an implementation of the decryption algorithm:

```python
HARDCODED_SALT = b"jHxastDcds)oMc=jvh7wdUhxcsdt2"    # decrypted string

def decrypt_payload(encrypted_blob):
    b64_decoded = base64.b64decode(encrypted_blob)
    decryption_key = b64_decoded[:0x10] + HARDCODED_SALT
    sha1hash = hashlib.sha1()
    sha1hash.update(decryption_key)
    decryption_key_hash = sha1hash.digest()
    rc4 = ARC4(decryption_key_hash)
    return rc4.decrypt(b64_decoded[0x10:])
```

The decrypted payload is in JSON form.

- Decrypted C2 Request: {"8":9,"1":17,"2":"pnmfcq111232"}
- Decrypted C2 Response: {"8":5,"16":770897804,"39":"V4UnoDQSEblewhh63UfUqAns","38":1}

# Commands List

After establishing communication, the C2 server will send commands indexes to be executed.

Here is the list of commands and their corresponding indexes (I have renamed the important commands).

[![20](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/20.png)](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/20.png)

It's worth mentioning that dynamic imports of the core DLL are stored in the same format as commands `"<address, API_index, DLL_index>"`, the API and DLL indexes are passed to the string decryption routine which returns their corresponding names then it uses `LoadLibrary` and `GetProcAddress` to resolve the imports.

[![21](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/21.png)](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/21.png)

Let's go through some of the interesting commands.

## Command 13: Lateral Movement

QBot can spread through the network by enumerating network shares using `WNetOpenEnumW()` and `WNetEnumResourceW`() then it drops a copy of Qbot into the shared folders.

Then the dropped executable is registered as an auto-start service on the target machine. The names for the service and the dropped file are randomly generated strings.

[![22](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/22.png)](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/22.png)

Finally, Qbot deletes the created service and dropped file from the target machine (as it's successfully infected).

## Command 21: Collecting Installed Applications

QBot can collect installed applications by enumeration subkeys of the registry key `"HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall"`.

[![23](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/23.png)](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/23.png)

The collected data is appended to the end of a string containing additional information about the victim's machine and time of collection.

`t=i1 time=[<time_of_collect>] ext_ip=[<external_IP>] dnsname=[?] hostname=[<computer_name>] user=[] domain=[] is_admin=[<YES/NO>] os=[<windows_ver>] qbot_version=[<qbot_ver>] install_time=[<qbot_install_time>] exe=[<injected_process>] prod_id=[NULL] iface_n=[<interface_IP>/<interface_IP>] UP] soft=[<app1;ver>|<app2;ver>|...]`

Example of collected data:

[![24](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/24.png)](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/24.png)

Then the data is RC4 encrypted and written to `"wdqlxw32.dll"` at the same directory of QBot.

Finally, `"wdqlxw32.dll"` is Zlib compressed and RC4 encrypted again then it's saved to `"cwdqlxw32.dll"` and the original `"wdqlxw32.dll"` is deleted.

[![25](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/25.png)](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/25.png)

The compressed file is then transfered to the C2 server (RC4 encrypted and Base64 encoded) in the key `"36"` and the compressed file `"cwdqlxw32.dll"` is also deleted.   

[![26](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/26.png)](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/26.png)

## Command 31: Fetching Plugins

As we said before, QBot is known to be a modular malware. It can load additional plugins received from the C2 server (plugins are RC4 encrypted and Base64 encoded).

QBot tries to inject the received plugin in 3 different processes depending on the machine architecture.

[![27](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/27.png)](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/27.png)

It creates a new suspended process then writes the plugin to the process memory using `WriteProcessMemory()` and then resumes the injected process. 

[![28](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/28.png)](/assets/images/malware-analysis/qbot-banking-trojan/28.png)

At the time of writing this, Qbot has 3 different plugins ("Password grabber", "Cookie grabber", "UPnP module").

# Conclusion

QBot is considered to be a sophisticated malware, it's receiving regular updates from time to time and it's not likely to go away anytime soon.

There is still more features that I didn't cover such as WebInjects so maybe I will come back to Qbot later I guess :)
